  I am a software engineer that enjoys working with a variety of technology, from backend to data science up through the client.
  A particular passion of mine is using machine learning to answer questions and surface information that would otherwise be too difficult to communicate.
  I am transhumanist at heart and believe that we are quickly moving towards a time where the boundary between user and computer will fade.
  I want to help us get there.
