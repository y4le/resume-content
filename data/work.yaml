      Initially worked on computer vision for warehouse robotics.
      Completed a camera calibration project before transitioning to a damage detection team due to team merger.
      Explored alternative loss functions to train on larger, noisier data sets in damage detection.
      Delivered detailed analyses and trained models for integration into the final Mixture of Experts (MoE) model.
      Contributed a model instrumental in achieving the team's year-end accuracy goal for the MoE system.
      Post goal-achievement, the entirety of my initial team, our manager, and our sibling teams were all laid off.
      Achieved top 10 leaderboard rankings in ML trainings for tabular data prediction, computer vision, and advanced ML.

      Worked on improving the default android "phone" app.
      Collaborated with a large team to build the automatic call screening feature.
      Worked with one other coworker to prototype a new test framework that is now in use to run the same test suite as unit/emulator/device tests.
      Handled client side implementation of the initial i18n pilot for call screen (Japanese support).
      Implemented and launched caller tags, a less specific type of caller ID that tells users what type of business is calling.
      Set up crowdsourcing flows to continually improve our caller ID/tag coverage.
      Built server side pipeline for internationalizing and hosting the set of available caller tags. Continuing work on server side heuristics/anti abuse policy to choose caller tags based on past feedback.
      Co-inventor of the patent for [automatic call screening](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2021101935A1)

    job_title: Full Stack Software Engineer
    start_date: '2017'
    end_date: '2018'
    notes: |
      Started off working on front end web. Demoed a react version of Tophatter but didn't get support to move forward with it.
      Learned Rails and transitioned to full stack.
      Pitched and worked with a team of 3 to build a collaborative filtering model for product recommendation.
      Worked with team of 3 to rebuild product deduplication pipeline from the ground up. Used neural networks to process item features into a few feature vectors, generated candidates using faiss vector similarity search, judged if candidates were actually duplicates using a random forest.
      Pitched, designed, and built a human review queue for our model to get ground truth data for product deduplication. This improved the performance of a NN I had set aside before to the point where it replaced the random forest model. Closed the training loop so the system will continue to improve with time.
      Infrastructure work on data pipelines. Built service that efficiently tracks recent user-product interactions using ring buffers in redis.
      In my final quarter I requested a week to work on web performance and had a big win by fixing viewport rendering - stat sig +6% new user conversion and +4% total revenue on web.
